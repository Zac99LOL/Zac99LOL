## hi guys

I code in Java, Python, Lua, and whenever I find inspiration I try and learn other languages. I am absolutely obsessed with Minecraft, particularly in the modding side of things, and have wanted to make mods since I started playing Java Edition.
I hate semicolons.

**Favourite Quote:** Good artists copy, great artists steal.
**Favourite Font:** JetBrains Mono. Even if it's not meant to be monospaced.

You can tell whether I'm being serious by whether I'm using proper punctuation and capitalisation properly.
